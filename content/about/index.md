## About Me

Hi, my name Pyero, i am just some dude who enjoy programming and math. I chose computer science as a major, I was thinking of choosing math or physics, but I realized that I have more opportunities in computer science. I dedicate my free time to my favorite hobbies: philosophy, mathematics, programming, chess and music.
