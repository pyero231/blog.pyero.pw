## Hello World!

> “You are never too old to learn more than you already know and to become able to do more than you already can.” - Isaac Asimov

Hi everybody, this is my first post in this blog, i will post a lot of things here, hope you enjoy my friend.

Anyway, I will use this blog to post personal things and opinions, I don't want to limit myself to a single topic, so I won't say a specific one.

Although in general in this blog I will deal with metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, mathematics, logic and computer science. Physics also interests me, but I don't love it as much as the formal sciences (Mathematics, computer science and logic).
